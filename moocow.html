        <h1>SAVE STREET COW'S</h1>
        <p> In , Hindusium the cow is not merely a living being but a sacred embodiment of motherhood and divine grace.
            She represents
            Dharma (righteousness), Ahimsa (non-violence), and Satvikta (purity). From ancient times, saints have taught
            that serving the cow purifies the soul and brings peace to the heart. Every part of the cow is considered
            beneficial to nature and humanity—her milk nourishes the body, her dung purifies the environment, and her
            presence brings positive energy. The cow teaches us humility, patience, and unconditional love, as she gives
            endlessly without expecting anything in return. Protecting the cow is not just an act of kindness but a path
            toward spiritual growth and harmony with nature. Therefore, Mahatmas urge us to see her as Gau Mata—the
            mother of all, worthy of reverence, protection, and care.</p>

                <h2>Street Cow, Bikaner, Rajasthan</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Like a person that has fallen in love, the more time I spend in India, the more I see India for its
                beauty and not its flaws – and there is so much beauty. But there are sights that jar me back to
                harsh
                reality and one of those is seeing a cow eat trash They commonly consume garbage, plastic, and other
                discarded materials, which can lead to various health and environmental issues Due to the lack of proper
                waste management and their scavenging nature, street cows often ingest plastic and other
                non-biodegradable items, which can be harmful to their health.</p>

                <h2>Street Cow, Mysore, Karnataka</h2>
            </div>
            <p>This happened nearly every morning I left my house in Mysore to walk to the medical clinic where I
                volunteered – Jag Therapy. Just a stone’s throw away from my house was a ditch filled with a
                sprawling pile of trash on an empty lot. Here I would often see a cow, and sometimes its cohorts,
                the cattle egret and crow, perusing the neighborhood effluvia. It was frustrating to witness, not
                merely because of the welfare problems present when cattle eat trash, including plastic bags, but
                more so because there was a neighborhood dumpster located a block away.</p>

                <h2>Street Cow, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh</h2>
            </div>
            <p>In Varanasi, a city full of devout Hindus, the loose cattle make their rounds, routinely collecting
                their offerings. Mrs. Gupta said that every morning a cow came into her courtyard and mooed, a
                signal that she should come down and deposit her kitchen scraps at the cow’s feet. In an ideal
                world, this is a beautiful system. No food goes to waste and what would be garbage is turned into
                valuable manure to be used for cooking fuel, fertilizer, and in some cases building material,
                household cleaner, or medicine.

            <p>Plastic not only affects the wellbeing of cattle, but also the people who consume milk from cattle
                who are allowed to roam free during the day and return to their owners in the evenings, or feral
                cattle, especially males that end up as meat whether legally, in the two states that allow slaughter
                and sale of beef, or in the illegal meat trade. Polymers in plastic are a carcinogen (a cancer
                causing agent) when consumed in animals or humans and ingesting milk or meat from cattle that have
                ingested plastic, sometimes in astounding quantities, is extremely harmful for human health</p>

                <h4>Dr. Jag’s cowshed, dyed yellow because of the cows’ turmeric baths the morning of the Sankranthi
                    festival. Mysore, Karnataka</h4>
            </div>
            <p>This problem is widely recognized, but the solutions do not appear to be easily forthcoming. Some
                states, like Uttar Pradesh, where Varanasi is located, have banned some plastic bags, only allowing
                plastic bags of a certain thickness (measured in microns). These thicker plastic bags are harder for
                cattle to eat and more valuable to ragpickers – a caste of people in India who collect garbage for
                reuse or recycling. Yet the law is either ignored or difficult to enforce. Officials either don’t
                measure the bags or accept bribes to allow vendors to continue using the illegal bags. Bribing
                officials is a ubiquitous practice throughout India and makes changing some public policies next to
                impossible.</p>

            <p>When I lived in Mysore we fed all our fruit and vegetable scraps to our friends’ cows. If it wasn’t
                convenient to feed their cows, I would place fruit and vegetable scraps directly on the ground so
                that any cows who wandered by could access the food with no danger of eating plastic. When I had
                some house guests stay with me, I gave them the house rules about trash removal – it is best to put
                food waste on the ground, but if you put it in a plastic bag, don’t tie the top of the bag, which
                allows the cows to forage through the trash without chewing through the plastic. :</p>

                <h2>Gaumata – Every part of the cow represents a divinity.</h2>
            </div>
            <p>

                the cow is revered as a sacred animal, primarily because it symbolizes motherhood, abundance, and
                the nurturing qualities of nature. It's considered a maternal figure, embodying the earth's
                fertility and providing sustenance through milk, a staple food in Hinduism. The cow's gentle nature
                and its contributions to agriculture and daily life also contribute to its sacred status. </p>

            <p> <span style="color:white; background: rgb(80, 87, 90);">In Hinduism, the cow is revered and often
                    worshipped, holding a sacred status as a symbol of
                    motherhood, abundance, and nature's bounty</span>, particularly represented by the concept of
                "Gau Mata"
                (divine mother cow). This reverence stems from the cow's association with deities like Lord Krishna
                and its role in providing essential resources like milk, which are seen as life-sustaining</p>
